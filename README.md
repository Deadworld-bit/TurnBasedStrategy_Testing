# Welcome to TurnBasedStrategy_Testing repository
## This repo stores unity projects. You will find in this repo the following stuff
* TurnBasedStrategy_Testing is a project built on a turn-based system where both characters and enemies act based on an action points system. These action points refresh at the start of each side's turn.
* The game utilizes a custom-built grid system for strategic movement, enhancing the tactical depth of gameplay.
* The game features an AI system for enemies to provide a more engaging and challenging combat experience.
* A pathfinding system ensures smooth and strategic navigation, allowing characters and enemies to find efficient routes across the grid.
* A basic UI is currently implemented and will receive updates to improve functionality and user experience.
* Assets and models from the Unity Asset Store are used to enrich the visual experience.
